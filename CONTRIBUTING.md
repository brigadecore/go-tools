# Contributing Guide

Brigade Go Tools is the source for an official Docker image used in the
production and testing of numerous other components of the Brigade project and
as such follows all of the policies laid out in the main
[Brigade Contributor Guide](https://docs.brigade.sh/topics/contributor-guide/).
Anyone interested in contributing to this repository should familiarize
themselves with that guide.
